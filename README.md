## INTRODUCTION

The game of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) involves two players simultaneously choosing either rock, paper, or scissors. Informally, the rules of the game are that “rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper”.

So, we have designed an application which has one person as computer and other person as the user. Here we have to choose on of the options from rock, paper and scissors and the computer will randomly choose its option and there will fun.
